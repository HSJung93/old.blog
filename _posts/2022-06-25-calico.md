Calico, the Open Source project that significantly extends the features of the built-in Kubernetes API in terms of network policies.

What are the advantages of using the built-in Kubernetes features together with the Calico APIs?

### NetworkPolicyâ€™s features

- policies are limited to an environment;
- policies are applied to pods marked with labels;
- you can apply rules to pods, environments or subnets;
- the rules may contain protocols, numerical or named ports.

### How Calico extends these features

- policies can be applied to any object: pod, container, virtual machine or interface;
- the rules can contain the specific action (restriction, permission, logging);
- you can use ports, port ranges, protocols, HTTP/ICMP attributes, IPs or subnets (v4 and v6), any selectors (selectors for nodes, hosts, environments) as a source or a target of the rules;
- also, you can control traffic flows via DNAT settings and policies for traffic forwarding.
