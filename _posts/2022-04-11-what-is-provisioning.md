In telecommunication, provisioning involves the process of preparing and equipping a network to allow it to provide new services to its users.

The concept of network provisioning or service mediation, mostly used in the telecommunication industry, refers to the provisioning of the customer's services to the network elements, which are various equipment connected in that network communication system. Generally in telephony provisioning this is accomplished with network management database table mappings.
