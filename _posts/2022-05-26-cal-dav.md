## WebDAV
* WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning) is an extension to HTTP that allows users to edit and manage files collaboratively on remote web servers.
* WebDAV extends HTTP with more of them like 
  * PROPFIND (retrieves properties of resources),
  * MKCOL (creates a new WebDAV collection), 
  * COPY and MOVE (copies and moves one resource from one URI to another)
  * LOCK and UNLOCK (creates and removes a shared or exclusive lock over a resource).
* WebDAV RFC chooses XML as the language to use over HTTP communication and there are DTDs (Document Type Definition) to define the XML data exchanged in every method.

## CalDAV
* CalDAV (Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV) is just another extension over WebDAV (RFC-4791) to specify a standard way of accessing, managing and sharing calendaring data based on the iCalendar format. 
* In summary it is a protocol to manage typical calendar resources (calendars, events, to-dos,...) as internet WebDAV collections.

## iCalendar
* iCalendar (Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification) is a data format (RFC-5545 replaced RFC-2445 and now defines the standard) for representing and exchanging calendaring and scheduling information such as events, to-dos, journal entries, and free/busy information, independent of any particular calendar service or protocol. 
* So, while CalDAV is the protocol to access and manage calendar resources, iCalendar is the format of the data stored in and retrieved from the server. 
* Other way of saying the same, a calendar server manages collections of iCalendar formatted resources accessed by users via CalDAV protocol.

## What is the current status of the development libraries about this protocol?

### CalDAV
* `caldav4j` is a project hosted by google which extends Apache Slide WebDAV protocol library and uses iCal4j for iCalendar data processing. 
* The main problem with `caldav4j` is that Apache abandoned Slide in 2007 and therefore it is base`d on a deprecated library

### WebDAV
*  Apache `Jackrabbit` is a fully conforming implementation of the Content Repository for Java Technology API or JCR.

### iCalendar
* `iCal4j` is a Java API that provides support for the iCalendar specification including a Parser, Object Model and Generator for iCalendar data streams.
