When classifying games through information, the complete information game and the perfect information game always make me confusing.

## Complete information

* An situation or game in which knowledge about other players is available to all participants. 
* The utility functions(including risk aversion), payoffs, strategies and "types" of players are thus common knowledge.
* For example of Incomplete information, in an **auction**, each player knows this own utility function(valuation for the item), but does not know the utility function of the other players.

## Perfection information

* Each player, when making any decision, is perfectly informed of all the events that have previously occurred, including the "initialization event" of the game (e.g. the starting hands of each player in a card game).
* Card games where each player's cards are hidden from other players such as **poker** and **bridge** are examples of games with imperfect information.
* Academic literature has not produced consensus on a standard definition of perfect information which defines whether games with chance, but no secret information, and games without simultaneous moves are games of perfect information.
* Games with simultaneous moves are generally not considered games of perfect information. Nevertheless, some such games are symmetrical, and fair. An example of a game in this category includes rock paper scissors.

## Distinguishing Examples

|           | Complete |    Incomplete    |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| Perfect   |          |  Ticket to Ride  |
| Imperfect | Poker    |                  |
