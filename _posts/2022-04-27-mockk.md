Mockk is a mocking framework built for Kotlin. Like Mockito, Mockk allows you to create and stub objects within your test code. Mocking objects allows you to test in isolation other objects. Any dependency of the object under test can be mocked to provide fixed conditions, thus ensuring specific and stable tests.

## How to use it
With Mockito this is how you mocked an object:
```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.mock;
MyClass mockedClass = mock(MyClass.class);
```
With Mockk it looks like this:
```kotlin
import io.mockk.mockk
val mockedClass = mockk<MyClass>()
```

## Why we switched
Mockk supports some important language features within Kotlin.

### Final by default
In contrast to Java, Kotlin classes (and functions) are final by default. This means Mockito requires extra configuration to enable it to work (and only in some cases). Whereas, Mockk can work around this using inline class transformation.

### Chained mocking
With Mockk you can chain your mocking, meaning you can provide concise and clear tests.
```kotlin
val mockedClass = mockk<MyClass>()
every { mockedClass.someMethod().someOtherMethod() } returns "Something"
```

### Object mocking
Kotlin objects map to Java statics. Mockito alone doesn't support mocking of statics. There are other frameworks you can combine with Mockito, but Mockk provides this out of the box.
```kotlin
mockObject(MyObject)
every { MyObject.someMethod() } returns "Something"
```

### Hierarchical mocking
While mocking out behaviour, you can create mocks and define their behaviour too.
```kotlin
val mockedClass = mockk<MyClass>()
every { mockedClass.someMethod() } returns mockk {
 every { someOtherMethod() } returns "Something"
}
```
