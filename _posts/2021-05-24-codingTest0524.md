Sliding window application, even if we can solve this problem with brute force algorithms

## Solution and Tips
```python
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s):
    ans = 0
    left = 0
    used = {}
    
    for right, char in enumerate(s):
        if char in used and left <= used[char]:
            left = used[char] + 1
        else:
            ans = max(ans, right - left + 1)
        used[char] = right
        
    return ans
```

* move right one-by-one with for statement and plug in to dictionary
* if char of pointer "right" is already in dictionary, we can update left to right 

## Problem
* Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Constraints:
* 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
* s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
