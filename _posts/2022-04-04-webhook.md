### What is webhook? 
A webhook in web development is a method of augmenting or altering the behavior of a web page or web application with custom callbacks. These callbacks may be maintained, modified, and managed by third-party users and developers who may not necessarily be affiliated with the originating website or application. Webhooks are sometimes referred to as "reverse APIs," because communication is initiated by the application sending the data rather than the one receiving it. 

### APIs vs Webhooks
An API (Application Programming Interface) enables two-way communication between software applications driven by requests. A webhook is a lightweight API that powers one-way data sharing triggered by events. Together, they enable applications to share data and functionality, and turn the web into something greater than the sum of its parts.

### Webhooks offer lightweight data sharing
A key advantage of webhooks is that they are easier to set up and less resource-intensive that APIs. Implementing a webhook simply requires setting up a single POST request on the sending end, establishing a URL on the receiving end to accept the data, then performing some action on the data once it is received.
