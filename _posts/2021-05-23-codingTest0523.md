Simple Singly-linked list application.

## Solution and Tips
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        e1 = 0
        e2 = 0
        
        n = 1
        while l1:
            e1 += l1.val*n
            l1 = l1.next
            n *= 10
            
        n = 1
        while l2:
            e2 += l2.val*n
            l2 = l2.next
            n *= 10
            
        e = e1 + e2
            
        header = None
        linked_list = None
        
        for c in str(e):
            if not header:
                header = ListNode(int(c))
                linked_list = header
            else:
                cur_node = ListNode(int(c), linked_list)
                linked_list = cur_node
                
        return linked_list
```

* By declaring header with None and using if not statement, we can make singly-linked list.

## Problem
* You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
* You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Constraints:
* The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
* 0 <= Node.val <= 9
* It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
